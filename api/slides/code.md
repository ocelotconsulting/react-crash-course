# About the example code

As you may have inferred by now... this is not PowerPoint :).  This content is built using Markdown, CSS, and the 
Prism syntax highlighting library.

The problem with using traditional presentation apps for technical presentations is that you really don't know whether
the example code actually works.  Instead, the examples in this project come straight from the source code. You can edit 
the code in the /src directory and any demo of that code currently displayed should reload.

Try to replace (your name here) with your name in Me.js:
  
___src/examples/Me.js
