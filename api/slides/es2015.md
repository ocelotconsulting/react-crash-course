# ES2015 (aka ES6)

React is designed for ES2015.  Most React code you'll see in the wild takes advantage of ES2015 features.  
For that reason, in these code examples we will:

+ Use **const** and **let** rather than **var**.
+ Use arrow functions for all functions other than class methods.
+ Use import/export rather than commonJS for all transpiled code - server-side code will be commonJS because Node 6 
  doesn't support import/export.
+ Use ES2015 classes in favor of **React.createClass**.
+ Use destructuring to reduce verbosity.
+ Use shortcut arrow functions where possible.
  
Please feel free to ask if you don't understand what a particular line of code does.

*Note*: the example code does not use semicolon terminators.  ES2015 does not do anything to rectify the potential 
issues that semicolon insertion can cause in JavaScript.  It's a team decision on whether you want to use semicolons;
I find that once you understand the issues eliminating the noise of semicolons is worth it but YMMV.
