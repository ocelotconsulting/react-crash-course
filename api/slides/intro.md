# What is React?

React is a library for creating user interfaces created by Facebook.  In the web space, it is a library for rendering DOM elements and 
efficiently updating the DOM when application state changes.  React is not a framework.  If you're familiar with MVC, 
then React is the 'V' (although MVC is not a term typically used to describe React apps).

Where other frameworks like Angular and Ember use HTML partials or templates, React is all JavaScript, although
most developers use JSX to embed XML to render the virtual DOM.

React is known for its performance (although other technologies such as Elm have adopted a similar approach to optimize
performance).  Performance is optimized through the use of a virtual DOM.

React is used exclusively in the web space by Facebook, AirBnB, Twitter, and many other companies.  React is under 
active development and seems to be overtaking Angular in popularity.  The next version of React will feature a new 
internal architecture to optimize performance further. 

When paired with a Flux library like Redux, React applications can be more predictable, testable, and easier to debug than MVC applications.
If you're a fan of functional programming, React+Redux will probably appeal to you.
