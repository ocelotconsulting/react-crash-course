# About JSX

JSX is a modern flavor of JavaScript which allows XML embedded inside code and code embedded in XML.  Code snippets
are delimited by squiggly braces.

JSX is arguably one of the great strengths of React.  Instead of embedding magic directives like 'ng-repeat' or 
code snippets in underscore/lodash/handlebars/etc templates, rendering code is all in the same place - there's just 
some markup mixed in.
  
As we will see with a later example, JSX is simply syntactic sugar for React API calls that construct the virtual DOM.
