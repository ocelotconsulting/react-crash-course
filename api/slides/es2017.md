# ES2016 and ES2017 features you should be using right now

ES2016 and ES2017 are in-general much smaller feature sets than the massive cahnges that came with ES2015.  

That being said, there are some really good improvements that are available without polifil in Node 8.5+ or in the browser via Babel.

### ES2016

- `Array.prototype.includes`
  - Allows you to check if an array contains the given value

### ES2017

- Async / Await
 - Allows for writing asyncronus code in a syncronus style
  - `async` 
    - This keyword is used to indicate that a funciton is asyncronus
    - The returned results from an `async` function are automatically converted into a promise
  - `await`
    - This keyword can only be used inside a function with the `async` keyword
    - The await keyword will extract the results from the promise that it is used on
